Most of this project was made in the span of 10 days for my Second-year University course "Math, Art, Code" (FA/DATT-2040). I thank my professor for enabling this opportunity. This is my ever first "complete" game experience, i.e.:
- A tutorial
- Sound effects and music
- Fully functioning gameplay and scoring system

Notable features:
- A webcam and ML-based handpose recognition system as your only character controls
- Carefully chosen gameplay mechanics (moveset, enemy variety) that are simple but create interesting and tight interactions and strategy

How it was made:
- Combining all my knowledge of the p5.js graphics library from the course with prior game engine experience
- A custom "game engine"-style backend model with Game Objects, a main Game World and GUI Loop, collision, and mass/velocity/acceleration-based physics
